# Global Water Scarcity & Consumption Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides an interactive **Tableau dashboard** analyzing global water scarcity and consumption trends. It utilizes a dataset containing **5,000 rows** of information related to water stress levels, consumption patterns, and affected populations worldwide.

## 📊 Features
- **Choropleth Map**: Visualizes global water stress levels by country.
- **Time-Series Line Chart**: Displays water consumption trends over the years.
- **Bar Chart**: Highlights the top 10 countries most affected by water scarcity.
- **Dual-Axis Chart**: Compares total water consumption vs. renewable water resources.
- **KPI Metrics**: Provides key insights such as total water consumption, average stress level, and affected population.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **File:** `global_water_scarcity.xlsx`
- **Columns:** Country, Year, Water Stress Level (%), Total Water Consumption (Million Cubic Meters), Renewable Water Resources (Billion Cubic Meters), Population Affected by Water Scarcity (Millions)
- **Size:** 5000 rows

## 🚀 How to Use
